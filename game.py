"""Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has 
to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he 
can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The 
game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game 
with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game will 
involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. 
Each room will print its own description when the player 
enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out 
of the map."""
